# GroundKit

GroundKit is a local-first documentation MCP for AI agents, built in .NET.

GroundKit builds documentation once, stores it as portable local packages, and serves it to AI agents through MCP without depending on a hosted documentation service.

The core model is simple:

- Ingest docs from a source such as a git repo, local folder, `llms.txt` site, or raw page.
- Normalize and chunk that content into a retrieval-friendly package.
- Store the package as a local SQLite `.db` file.
- Let MCP clients query those local packages repeatedly with low latency.

## Product direction

GroundKit is meant to cover the full local documentation workflow:

1. Detect a documentation source from a local folder, git repo, `llms.txt` site, or raw page.
2. Build a portable local package once for a specific source snapshot.
3. Store that package in SQLite with retrieval-friendly chunk metadata.
4. Expose MCP tools that let an agent resolve sources and query focused sections.
5. Keep the common path fully local after ingestion.
6. Add enough CLI and lifecycle tooling that teams can build, install, update, inspect, and share packages.

## Coverage map

### Implemented now

- .NET 10 solution split into ingestion, storage, MCP, observability, app host, and tests.
- Local directory ingestion.
- Git repository ingestion through clone-to-temp build flow.
- Automatic latest stable Git tag selection for repository sources, with explicit
  `--tag` and interactive `--choose-tag` support.
- `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` ingestion.
- Raw page ingestion with HTML-to-text fallback handling.
- Automatic source detection for local folder, git repo, `llms.txt`, and raw page inputs.
- Package build pipeline producing manifests, documents, chunks, fingerprints, and warnings.
- SQLite-backed package store.
- Lexical retrieval with max token budget, max hits, and relative score cutoff.
- MCP stdio server.
- MCP tools for source resolution and docs querying.
- Context7-style MCP compatibility tools: `get_docs` and `library_catalog`.
- Curated starter catalog of 20 popular JavaScript and web libraries.
- Declarative `registry/` starter definitions mirroring the curated catalog.
- Registry client with package search, versioned download, and local fallback.
- CLI commands for local package lifecycle, registry workflows, catalog discovery, and MCP serving.
- Portable package import/export using SQLite `.db` artifacts.
- Basic OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics hooks.

### Next to build

- Better docs-root discovery and stronger repository heuristics.
- Smarter markdown and HTML chunking closer to docs structure instead of simple section splitting only.
- Adjacent-chunk merge in retrieval so agents get coherent sections rather than isolated fragments.
- Package metadata inspection and health diagnostics.
- Narrow integration and unit tests around ingestion, storage, and MCP tool contracts.

### Out of scope for current phase

- Team sync service.
- Embeddings or vector search.
- Semantic or graph retrieval.
- Multi-tenant or cloud deployment concerns.

## Current architecture

Current repo shape already matches the local-first core:

- Ingestion builds packages from source material.
- Storage persists package data under `.groundkit/packages` or `GROUNDKIT_HOME/packages`.
- MCP exposes query tools over stdio.
- Observability keeps the core path measurable.

That means the project is past the idea stage. Main gap now is not core direction, but finishing the developer workflow around package lifecycle and tightening retrieval quality.

## How the MCP server works

GroundKit follows a two-phase model:

1. Build a docs package once.
2. Store it locally as SQLite.
3. Let the MCP server answer future agent queries from local data instead of a hosted docs API.

In other words, ingestion happens ahead of time and retrieval happens on demand.

### Runtime flow

When you run `serve`, the app host starts a stdio MCP server. The MCP registration comes from the `GroundKit.Mcp` assembly, where tool methods are discovered and exposed through the Model Context Protocol server SDK.

At runtime the agent talks to GroundKit over stdio, not HTTP. The server does not fetch the internet during the normal query path. It assumes packages have already been built and installed locally under the package store directory.

That keeps the hot path small:

1. MCP client sends a tool call.
2. GroundKit loads package metadata or opens a local SQLite package.
3. GroundKit returns structured results and a compact readable summary.

### Tool surface

Current MCP surface is intentionally small:

- `resolve-source`: finds installed packages by package id or display name.
- `query-docs`: searches one installed package for relevant sections under a token budget.

This keeps the server focused on retrieval. Package creation, refresh, import, and export happen in the CLI workflow, while the MCP layer serves already-installed packages.

### What happens on `resolve-source`

`resolve-source` loads the installed package list from the local package store and performs simple lexical matching against package id and display name. It scores exact matches highest, then partial matches, then term overlap.

The result is returned in two forms:

- Structured JSON payload for MCP-aware clients.
- Concise plain-text summary for agents that benefit from readable tool output.

That dual-output pattern is important in this repo: tool calls return machine-readable data, but also a compact human-readable rendering generated by the local response formatter.

### What happens on `query-docs`

`query-docs` takes a package id and a topic. The package store opens the package's SQLite database and runs an FTS5 search against indexed chunk content.

Current retrieval path is:

1. Build FTS query from topic text.
2. Search the local SQLite FTS table.
3. Rank hits with BM25 weighting.
4. Drop weak results using a relative score cutoff.
5. Trim the final result set to the requested token budget.
6. Return both structured hit data and concise plain-text summaries.

This keeps the retrieval path fast and fully local. Expensive work belongs in package build time, not in every MCP call.

### Why response formatting is split from retrieval

This repo separates retrieval from presentation.

- `IPackageStore` and the SQLite store own package lookup and search.
- MCP tools own argument validation and tool contracts.
- `GroundKitToolResponseAgent` converts structured payloads into compact plain text.

That means the MCP layer can serve both structured clients and text-oriented agents without changing the retrieval engine.

### End-to-end mental model

You can think of GroundKit as two phases:

1. Offline or pre-query phase: `add` builds a package from git, local docs, `llms.txt`, or a raw page and stores it as a local SQLite `.db` file.
2. Online query phase: `serve` exposes MCP tools that resolve packages and query those local SQLite packages with no hosted dependency.

That is the core architectural idea behind GroundKit: build once, query locally many times.

## CLI reference

GroundKit is consumed as a .NET tool. After installation, run commands with
`groundkit --<command>`. Running GroundKit without a command prints the command
list.

Install GroundKit as a global .NET tool:

```powershell
dotnet tool install --global GroundKit
groundkit --list
```

For a locally built package, install from its package directory:

```powershell
dotnet pack src/groundkit -c Release
dotnet tool install --global --add-source ./src/groundkit/bin/Release GroundKit
```

Update a NuGet installation with `dotnet tool update --global GroundKit`.
Update a local package installation with `dotnet tool update --global
--add-source ./src/groundkit/bin/Release GroundKit`.

Contributors can run the repository wrapper without installing the tool:

```powershell
.\groundkit.ps1 --list
.\groundkit.ps1 --query skills "hooks"
```

PowerShell does not search the current directory for commands, so use the
`.\groundkit.ps1` prefix. Bare `groundkit --list` requires the installed tool
directory to be on `PATH`.

```powershell
groundkit --list
groundkit --inspect react
groundkit --query react "useEffect cleanup"
```

Flag-style forms are aliases; existing positional forms such as `groundkit list`
continue to work.

### `groundkit add <source>`

Build and install a package from source. Source type is detected automatically.
Use this for libraries missing from the registry, private or internal docs, or
when you need to build from a specific source yourself.

The examples below use the installed `groundkit` executable.

The flag form, `groundkit --add <source>`, is also supported.

**From the starter catalog:**

```bash
groundkit --add react
groundkit --catalog react
```

**From a git repository:**

```bash
# HTTPS URLs from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, or another git host
groundkit add https://github.com/mattpocock/skills

# Build from a specific tag or branch
groundkit add https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/v1.2.3
groundkit add https://github.com/mattpocock/skills --tag v1.2.3

# Select documentation stored below a repository root
groundkit add https://github.com/mattpocock/skills  --docs-path src/content
```

By default, `add` discovers tags and uses the latest stable SemVer tag. Use
`--tag <tag>` to pin an exact tag for automation. Use `--choose-tag` to select
from available stable tags interactively; the default picker choice is latest
stable tag. If no stable tags are available, GroundKit uses the default branch.
GitHub-style `/tree/<branch-or-tag>` URLs are also supported and select that ref
directly.

GroundKit clones git sources into a temporary directory, reads and indexes the
documentation, stores the resulting SQLite package locally, and removes the
temporary clone after the build succeeds or fails.

**From a local directory:**

Clone the sample repository, then let GroundKit discover its top-level `docs/`
folder automatically:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mattpocock/skills ./skills
groundkit add ./skills
```

Use `--path` when the folder to index is not the first detected docs folder.
For example, load the repository's `skills/` folder explicitly:

```bash
groundkit add ./skills --path skills
```

`--path` is also useful when documentation lives in a custom directory. The
older `--docs-path` spelling remains supported:

```bash
groundkit add /path/to/repo --path docs
groundkit add /path/to/repo --docs-path documentation
```

Set a stable package identity and version while loading the cloned repository:

```bash
groundkit add ./skills --path docs --name mattpocock-skills --pkg-version 1.0.0
```

Save an additional copy for sharing while still installing the package locally:

```bash
groundkit add ./skills --path docs --name mattpocock-skills --pkg-version 1.0.0 \
  --save ./artifacts/mattpocock-skills@1.0.0.db
```

`--save` accepts a `.db` file path or a directory. When given a directory,
GroundKit uses the installed package filename inside that directory.

GroundKit checks local directories for `docs/`, `documentation/`, then `doc/`.
If none exists, it indexes the source root. Relative paths passed to `--path`
resolve from the local source directory.

**From a website, URL, or package file:**

```bash
groundkit --add ./my-project --docs-path docs
groundkit --add https://docs.example.com
groundkit --add https://cdn.example.com/react@18.db
groundkit --add ./react@19.1.0.db
```

`add` supports `--path <path>` and its `--docs-path <path>` alias for repository
or directory sources. It builds locally and stores the resulting SQLite
package; it does not query or download from the registry. `--name <name>`
overrides the package ID and display name, while `--pkg-version <version>`
stores an explicit package and source version.

To import an existing local or remote `.db` package, use `install`:

```bash
groundkit --install ./react@19.1.0.db
groundkit --install https://example.com/react@19.1.0.db
```

For a website root, `add` first probes `/llms-full.txt` and `/llms.txt`. If
neither endpoint exists, root-URL fallback to the page itself is not currently
implemented. Direct article and raw Markdown URLs do work:

```bash
groundkit --add https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/
groundkit --add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuledge/context/main/README.md
```

If a source produces fewer than three indexed sections, GroundKit prints a
low-section warning suggesting that documentation may be in another repository
or subfolder. It does not currently generate a Google search link.

### `groundkit install <registry/name|name|source> [version]`

Install with local-first resolution. This is the fallback-capable workflow:

```bash
# Search registry only when no matching local package exists
groundkit --install npm/react

# Request exact version
groundkit --install npm/react 19.1.0

# Bare names default to npm
groundkit --install react

# Missing registry package falls back to local catalog/source build
groundkit --install react 19.1.0
```

Resolution order:

1. Reuse matching package already in local store. No network request.
2. Search configured registry and import matching `.db` artifact.
3. If registry has no match or is unavailable, build from the catalog or source locally.

### `groundkit --search-packages <registry> <name> [version]`

Search registry metadata and versions. Search is read-only: it never downloads
or installs a package.

```bash
groundkit --search-packages npm react
groundkit --search-packages npm react 19.1.0
groundkit --search-packages pip django
```

### `groundkit --download-package <registry> <name> <version>`

Download one exact pre-built registry package. This is strict and does not
fallback to another version or local build when the artifact is unavailable.

```bash
groundkit --download-package npm react 19.1.0
```

Use `install` instead when registry failure should trigger local fallback.

### `groundkit --import <package-file>` and `groundkit --export <package-id> <destination>`

Import or share portable SQLite package artifacts without rebuilding:

```bash
groundkit --import ./artifacts/react@19.1.0.db
groundkit --export react ./artifacts
```

### `groundkit --list`, `--inspect`, `--query`, `--refresh`, and `--remove`

- `--list` displays installed package ids, versions, document counts, chunk counts, and build times.
- `--inspect <package-id>` displays package metadata, source information, and local database path.
- `--query <package-id> <topic>` searches one installed package locally.
- `--refresh <package-id>` rebuilds a package from its recorded source.
- `--remove <package-id>` removes an installed package and its local files.

Examples:

```bash
groundkit --list
groundkit --inspect react
groundkit --query react "useEffect cleanup"
groundkit --export react ./artifacts
```

### Start MCP servers

- `--serve` starts the MCP server over stdio. It reads only packages already in the local store.
- `--serve --libs package-a,package-b` restricts the session to selected installed package names.
- `--serve-http` starts the HTTP MCP host and exposes MCP at `/mcp`. Use `--urls` through the host configuration to select its listening URL.

Examples:

```bash
groundkit --serve
groundkit --serve --libs react,vite
groundkit --serve-http --urls http://localhost:3001
```

### `groundkit --catalog [query]`

List the initial curated sources:

```bash
groundkit --catalog
groundkit --catalog react
```

Catalog names can be passed directly to `--add`. GroundKit expands them to their
known repository and documentation path before building a local package:

```bash
groundkit --add react
```

The MCP server exposes `library_catalog` for discovery and `get_docs` as the
Context7-compatible name for the existing local retrieval tool. `resolve-source`
and `query-docs` remain available for existing clients.

## Registry packages, bundles, and OCI distribution

GroundKit can use any compatible GroundKit registry. Default registry address is
`http://localhost:8080`. Registry access is explicit and user-controlled:
GroundKit never downloads packages in the background, during `serve`, or merely
because a package name appears in configuration. A package is downloaded only
after the user runs `download-package` or `install`.

There are three end-user registry workflows:

1. **Search, then choose.** Run `search-packages` to inspect available versions.
   This is discovery only and never changes the local store. Then run
   `download-package` for the exact version you approve.
2. **Explicit registry download.** Run `download-package <registry> <name> <version>`
   when you already know the exact artifact to install. This is the
   strict path for reproducible installs.
3. **Local-first install.** Run `install <registry/name> [version]` or
   `install <name> [version]`. GroundKit first checks the local store, then
   searches the registry and installs a matching artifact, then builds from the
   catalog or supplied source locally if registry lookup has no match or the
   registry cannot be reached.

Examples for each workflow:

```bash
# 1. Search, review versions, then choose one
groundkit --search-packages npm next
groundkit --download-package npm next 15.5.0

# 2. Install one exact artifact without discovery
groundkit --download-package npm react 19.1.0

# 3. Let local-first install resolve registry or local fallback
groundkit --install npm/vite
groundkit --install react 19.1.0
```

For `install`, resolution order is:

1. Matching package already exists in the local store. No network request is made.
2. Registry search finds a matching package. GroundKit downloads the `.db` artifact and imports it locally.
3. Registry has no match or cannot be reached. GroundKit builds from the built-in catalog or the supplied local/source input and saves that package locally.

`download-package` is intentionally strict: it installs the requested registry
artifact and reports an error if that exact registry download fails. Use
`install` when local fallback is required. After any successful registry import,
MCP queries use the local SQLite package and do not contact the registry.

### Configure registry address

Set registry address per project in `.groundkit/config.json`:

```json
{
  "RegistryUrl": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

Or override it for one shell/session with `GROUNDKIT_REGISTRY_URL`:

```powershell
$env:GROUNDKIT_REGISTRY_URL = "https://registry.example.com"
groundkit --search-packages npm react
```

Environment variables take precedence over `.groundkit/config.json`. Copy
`.groundkit/config.example.json` to `.groundkit/config.json` for a complete
example. `HttpHeaders` can provide registry authentication or other request
headers; do not commit credentials to project configuration.

### Registry API option

The HTTP registry is the native distribution option for GroundKit clients. A
registry server provides searchable metadata and immutable SQLite artifacts:

```http
GET /search?registry=npm&name=react&version=19.1.0
GET /packages/npm/react/19.1.0
GET /packages/npm/react/19.1.0/download
```

Run the included local registry with Docker Compose:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set REGISTRY_PUBLISH_KEY in .env
docker compose up --build
```

The registry API listens on `http://localhost:8080`. Point GroundKit at another
server with `.groundkit/config.json`:

```json
{
  "RegistryUrl": "https://registry.example.com",
  "HttpHeaders": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer replace-me"
  }
}
```

`GROUNDKIT_REGISTRY_URL` overrides `RegistryUrl` for a shell/session. Use
`HttpHeaders` for private registry request headers, but keep secrets out of
committed files. MinIO backs the included registry storage at
`http://localhost:9001`; clients use the API address, not the MinIO address.

### Bundle option for offline or bulk transfer

The registry maintainer CLI builds packages and creates a bundle containing all
`.db` files, `index.json`, and `SHA256SUMS`:

```bash
groundkit-registry --validate --dir registry
groundkit-registry --build-all --dir registry --output ./dist-packages
groundkit-registry --bundle --output ./dist-packages --format zip
groundkit-registry --bundle --output ./dist-packages --format tar.gz
```

Import a bundle on an offline machine, then query or serve the imported packages:

```bash
groundkit-registry --import-bundle \
   ./dist-packages/groundkit-registry.zip --output ./imported-packages
groundkit --import ./imported-packages/react@19.1.0.db
groundkit --list
```

The bundle is a distribution artifact, not a live registry. It does not enable
`search-packages` until its individual `.db` files have been imported into the
local GroundKit store or published to an HTTP registry.

### GitHub Actions artifact option

The included `Registry Update` workflow runs on schedule, manual dispatch, and
published releases. It validates definitions, builds individual `.db` files,
creates ZIP and tar.gz bundles, and uploads them as a GitHub Actions artifact
named `groundkit-registry-<run-id>`.

Download that artifact from GitHub Actions or with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh run list --workflow registry-update.yml
gh run download <run-id> --name groundkit-registry-<run-id> --dir ./registry-download
groundkit --import ./registry-download/react@19.1.0.db
```

GitHub Actions artifacts are suitable for CI handoff and short-lived builds.
The workflow currently retains them for 14 days, so use a release asset, bundle
archive, or HTTP registry for durable distribution.

### OCI option through GHCR

On manual workflow runs and published releases, the workflow also pushes each
`.db` package to GitHub Container Registry as an OCI artifact using ORAS. OCI
packages are useful when teams already authenticate to GHCR and want immutable
content-addressed artifacts; GroundKit's registry client does not pull GHCR
artifacts directly.

```bash
oras login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin
oras pull ghcr.io/OWNER/groundkit-packages:react--19.1.0-<commit12>
groundkit --import ./react--19.1.0-<commit12>.db
```

The workflow uses an immutable tag containing the package name/version and the
first 12 characters of the commit SHA. Check the workflow logs or GHCR package
metadata for the exact tag. OCI artifact media types are:

```text
application/vnd.groundkit.package.v1+sqlite
application/vnd.groundkit.package.v1
```

Use the HTTP registry API when GroundKit users need `search-packages` and
`install`; use bundles, GitHub artifacts, or OCI when distributing artifacts
outside a registry API.

### Registry maintainer commands

`src/groundkit-registry` is separate from the user-facing `src/groundkit` CLI:

```bash
groundkit-registry --list --dir registry
groundkit-registry --validate --dir registry
groundkit-registry --build react --dir registry --output ./dist-packages
groundkit-registry --build react 19.1.0 --dir registry --output ./dist-packages
groundkit-registry --publish react --dir registry --output ./dist-packages
groundkit-registry --publish-all --dir registry --output ./dist-packages
```

Set `REGISTRY_SERVER_URL` and `REGISTRY_PUBLISH_KEY` when publishing to an
HTTP registry. Publishing is for maintainers or CI; end users only need the
registry URL and read access.

### Opt-in package policy

Default policy is manual approval. Keep `.groundkit/config.json` focused on
connection and limits; it is not a package download list. Review packages with
`search-packages`, then explicitly run `download-package` or `install`. Start
the MCP server only after approved packages appear in `list`.

MCP agents can use `search_packages`, `download_package`, and `get_docs`, but
tool availability does not trigger downloads automatically. Downloaded `.db`
packages are imported into the local store and queried without a network call.

## Near-term roadmap

1. Tighten package lifecycle UX and semantics: naming, versioning, inspection, and refresh behavior.
2. Tighten build fidelity: docs path discovery, source versioning, better chunking, dedupe, and warnings.
3. Tighten retrieval quality: title weighting, adjacent merge, better formatting for agent consumption.
4. Expand tests around end-to-end local package build, export/import, and query behavior.
5. Consider optional later-phase features only after the local lexical path feels solid.

## Success criteria

GroundKit is successful when a developer can:

1. Point the tool at a repo, local docs folder, `llms.txt` site, or raw page.
2. Build a local package once.
3. Run the MCP server locally.
4. Let an agent resolve installed sources and query docs with no hosted dependency.
5. Share the resulting package artifact with another machine without rebuilding from scratch.
