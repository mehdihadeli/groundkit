# Package workflow

Packages are versioned evidence artifacts. Build or import the package that matches the dependency version used by the project; do not combine multiple versions in one lookup workflow without making that choice explicit.

The repository also includes a declarative starter registry in `registry/`. Its YAML files describe source locations for the curated catalog. The current CLI still builds from a source URL or catalog entry; YAML discovery and registry publishing are future work.

## Sources

The builder accepts local directories, Git repositories, `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` URLs, and arbitrary documentation pages.

For a website root, GroundKit probes `/llms-full.txt` first and then `/llms.txt`.
If the available `llms.txt` is an index rather than inlined documentation,
GroundKit follows its links and fetches the linked documents. A direct
`llms.txt` URL is also supported:

```bash
groundkit add https://agentgateway.dev
groundkit add https://agentgateway.dev/llms.txt
groundkit add https://agentgateway.dev --name agent-gateway
```

If neither llms endpoint exists, a website root falls back to fetching its page
directly. HTML pages use readable article extraction so navigation, subscription
calls to action, and comment widgets are not indexed. Raw Markdown URLs are
indexed directly, including GitHub blob URLs:

```bash
groundkit add https://agentgateway.dev/blog/2026-08-20-benchmarking-agentgateway-epp-proxy-overhead/
groundkit add https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/blob/main/README.md --name agentgateway-readme
```

### Local directories

When the source is a local directory, GroundKit checks these folders in order:

1. `docs/`
2. `documentation/`
3. `doc/`
4. `website/docs/`
5. `guides/`
6. `guide/`
7. `manual/`
8. `reference/`
9. `content/`
10. `wiki/`

GroundKit selects the candidate containing the most supported documentation
files. If none contains documentation, it scans the repository root. Set
`--path` when documentation lives elsewhere:

```bash
groundkit add ./my-library
groundkit add ./my-library --path handbook
```

`--docs-path` remains available as an alias for `--path`. Relative paths resolve from the source directory; absolute paths are also supported.

If no supported documentation files are found, `add` creates the package with
zero documents and prints a warning containing a Perplexity search link. A
small package also receives a warning with the same suggestion because the
project may keep documentation in a separate repository, such as a
`project-docs`, `project.dev`, or `project-website` repository.

### Git repositories

GroundKit accepts GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Codeberg repository URLs. GitHub tree URLs preserve their selected ref, and `--tag` explicitly selects a tag or branch:

```bash
groundkit add https://github.com/mattpocock/skills --tag main
```

Without an explicit ref, GroundKit chooses the latest stable tag when the remote exposes tags. Add `--choose-tag` for interactive selection.

### Package identity

By default, package ID and display name come from the source name. Override them and attach a version when publishing or maintaining multiple builds from one source:

```bash
groundkit add ./my-library --name my-library --pkg-version 1.0.0
```

The custom name is used for package and source identity; the custom version is stored in both package and source metadata and is shown by `inspect`.

Save a portable copy while also installing the package locally:

```bash
groundkit add ./my-library --path docs --name my-library --pkg-version 1.0.0 --save ./artifacts
```

`--save` accepts either a destination directory or a `.db` file path. A
directory receives the normal package filename, making the copy ready for
sharing or importing on another machine.

Host a saved database on an HTTP server and add its URL from another machine:

```bash
groundkit add https://github.com/mattpocock/skills --path docs \
	--name mattpocock-skills --pkg-version 1.2.3 \
	--save ./artifacts/mattpocock-skills@1.2.3.db

groundkit add https://packages.example.com/mattpocock-skills@1.2.3
```

Remote package URLs may use either the `.db` filename or a hosted
`name@version` path. GroundKit imports the artifact into its local package
store; subsequent queries do not contact the host.

The same artifact can be imported from the local filesystem:

```bash
groundkit add ./mattpocock-skills@1.2.3.db
```

During ingestion, GroundKit records source kind, canonical source ID, location, optional version, tag or branch, fingerprint, build timestamps, document counts, chunk counts, and warnings. Use `inspect` to review this provenance.

## Portable artifacts

Export a package for another machine:

```bash
groundkit export react ./artifacts
```

Import it into the local store:

```bash
groundkit import ./artifacts/react@dev.db
```

Remove an installed package with a bare name when only one version is present,
or target an exact version with `name@version`:

```bash
groundkit remove mattpocock-skills
groundkit remove mattpocock-skills@1.2.3
groundkit remove agentgateway
```

When several versions are installed, GroundKit asks you to choose a version in
an interactive terminal. Non-interactive removal lists the installed versions
and deletes nothing until an exact version is supplied.

## Refresh

Refresh from stored source metadata after documentation changes:

```bash
groundkit refresh react
```

Refresh rebuilds the package from its stored source metadata. It does not make a local query live or guarantee that an upstream branch has not changed. For reproducible grounding, prefer an exact Git tag or dependency version, then export the resulting `.db` artifact for teammates or CI.

## Evidence workflow

```bash
groundkit inspect react
groundkit query react "useEffect cleanup"
```

Check package identity, version, source, and build time before treating a result as authoritative. An empty query result means the package did not provide evidence for that query; it does not prove that the documented feature does not exist.
