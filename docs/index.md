  <strong>Core promise:</strong> exact library version, local source, inspectable retrieval.

## Choose your starting point

Start with the workflow that matches your next task. Each path leads to a concrete action instead of a product tour.

<div class="home-paths">
  <a href="/libraries" class="home-path">
    <strong>Find a library</strong>
    <span>Browse 20 curated sources and build one with a short command.</span>
  </a>
  <a href="/features" class="home-path">
    <strong>Understand the workflow</strong>
    <span>See how ingestion, retrieval, MCP, and team sharing fit together.</span>
  </a>
  <a href="/integrations" class="home-path">
    <strong>Connect an agent</strong>
    <span>Connect with stdio or Streamable HTTP from your MCP-compatible host.</span>
  </a>
</div>

## Made for agent workflows

Documentation lookup should disappear into the development loop. Add packages during project setup, ship them with a team workspace, or rebuild them in CI. The agent gets the same evidence every time.

<div class="home-grid">
  <a href="/features" class="home-grid-item">
    <span class="home-grid-kicker">WORKFLOWS</span>
    <strong>Coding assistants</strong>
    <span>Keep framework APIs aligned with the version in your project.</span>

  <a href="/features" class="home-grid-item">
    <span class="home-grid-kicker">KNOWLEDGE</span>
    <strong>Private runbooks</strong>
    <span>Index internal Markdown and keep proprietary context on your machine.</span>
  </a>
  <a href="/features" class="home-grid-item">
    <span class="home-grid-kicker">AUTOMATION</span>
    <strong>CI pipelines</strong>
    <span>Use deterministic packages for review bots, migrations, and validation.</span>
  </a>

## One server, any MCP client

GroundKit speaks standard stdio MCP and Streamable HTTP. Connect it to your editor, agent host, or shared container, then use the same package store from interactive sessions and automation.
